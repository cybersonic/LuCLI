# LuCLI Command Consistency & JMX Monitoring Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to ensure command consistency between LuCLI's one-shot CLI commands and interactive terminal mode, along with the implementation of comprehensive JMX monitoring functionality.

## Problem Statement

Previously, there was inconsistency between commands available in:
- **One-shot CLI mode**: `java -jar lucli.jar [command]`
- **Interactive terminal mode**: Commands available after running `java -jar lucli.jar terminal`

Users expected the same commands to work in both modes, but this wasn't the case.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Command Consistency Improvements

#### Updated SimpleTerminal.java
- Added support for `version` and `--version` commands (matches CLI `--version`)
- Added support for `lucee-version` and `--lucee-version` commands (matches CLI `--lucee-version`)
- Updated help documentation to include these new commands
- Added `showLuceeVersion()` method for terminal mode

#### Updated CommandProcessor.java
- Enhanced `server` command to support the `monitor` subcommand
- Added `handleServerMonitor()` method
- Updated help text to include monitor command in available server operations
- Added proper error handling for monitor command

### 2. JMX Monitoring Implementation

#### New Classes Created

**JmxConnection.java**
- Utility class for connecting to JMX-enabled Lucee servers
- Retrieves comprehensive metrics: memory, threading, GC, runtime, OS
- Includes inner classes for structured metric data
- Proper resource management with AutoCloseable interface

**CliDashboard.java**
- ASCII-based dashboard renderer with progress bars and gauges
- Color-coded display (green/yellow/red) based on usage percentages
- Professional terminal UI with box drawing characters
- Real-time formatting and display of server metrics

**MonitorCommand.java**
- Main interactive monitoring command
- Configurable host, port, and refresh interval
- Interactive controls (q to quit, r to refresh, h for help)
- Proper cleanup and shutdown handling
- Threaded input handling for non-blocking operation

#### Integration with LuCLI
- Added monitor subcommand to server management system
- Updated help documentation throughout the system
- Proper argument parsing and command routing

### 3. Command Consistency Matrix

| CLI Mode | Terminal Mode | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| `--version` | `version` | ✅ Consistent |
| `--lucee-version` | `lucee-version` | ✅ Consistent |
| `server start` | `server start` | ✅ Consistent |
| `server stop` | `server stop` | ✅ Consistent |
| `server status` | `server status` | ✅ Consistent |
| `server list` | `server list` | ✅ Consistent |
| `server monitor` | `server monitor` | ✅ Consistent |
| `help` | `help` | ✅ Consistent |

### 4. Additional Terminal Features

Terminal mode includes exclusive features not available in CLI mode:
- File system commands (ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, cp, mv, rm, cat, etc.)
- CFML expression execution (`cfml <expression>`)
- Interactive prompt customization (`prompt` command)
- Script execution (`run` command)
- External command support

## JMX Monitoring Features

### Key Metrics Displayed
- **Memory Usage**: Heap and non-heap memory with usage percentages
- **Threading**: Active, peak, and daemon thread counts
- **Garbage Collection**: Collection counts and times for all GC types
- **Runtime**: JVM uptime, version information
- **System Resources**: CPU load, system load average, available processors
- **Lucee-specific**: Server-specific metrics when available

### Interactive Controls
- `q`, `quit`, `exit` - Quit monitoring
- `r`, `refresh` - Force refresh
- `h`, `help` - Show help
- `c`, `clear` - Clear screen

### Configuration Options
- `--host, -h` - JMX host (default: localhost)
- `--port, -p` - JMX port (default: 8999)
- `--refresh, -r` - Refresh interval in seconds (default: 3)

## Usage Examples

### CLI Mode
```bash
# Show version
java -jar lucli.jar --version

# Monitor server with default settings
java -jar lucli.jar server monitor

# Monitor with custom settings
java -jar lucli.jar server monitor --host myserver --port 9999 --refresh 5

# Show monitor help
java -jar lucli.jar server monitor --help
```

### Terminal Mode
After running `java -jar lucli.jar terminal` or just `java -jar lucli.jar`:

```
LuCLI> version                    # Shows LuCLI version
LuCLI> lucee-version             # Shows Lucee version
LuCLI> server list               # Lists all server instances
LuCLI> server monitor            # Information about monitoring
LuCLI> cfml now()                # Execute CFML expressions
LuCLI> ls -la                    # File system commands
LuCLI> help                      # Show all available commands
```

## Implementation Benefits

### For Users
- **Consistent Experience**: Same commands work in both modes
- **Predictable Behavior**: Users don't need to learn different command sets
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time server performance metrics
- **Visual Dashboard**: Easy-to-read ASCII dashboard with progress indicators

### For Developers  
- **Maintainable Code**: Centralized command handling
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new commands consistently
- **Proper Resource Management**: Clean shutdown and resource cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- CLI one-shot commands (`--version`, `server monitor --help`)
- Terminal mode commands (`version`, `server monitor`)
- Help system consistency
- Error handling and edge cases
- Resource cleanup and proper shutdown

## Conclusion

The command consistency improvements and JMX monitoring implementation provide:

1. **Unified Command Interface**: Users can expect the same commands to work in both CLI and terminal modes
2. **Professional Monitoring**: Real-time server monitoring with visual feedback
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Consistent, predictable behavior across all interaction modes
4. **Developer-Friendly**: Clean, maintainable code architecture

This ensures LuCLI provides a consistent and professional experience whether used as a one-shot CLI tool or an interactive terminal application.
