Frequently asked questions about LuCLI.

## Do I need to install Lucee separately?

No. LuCLI downloads and manages Lucee Express distributions under `~/.lucli/express/` and creates per‑project servers under `~/.lucli/servers/`.

## Where does LuCLI store servers and modules?

- Servers: `~/.lucli/servers/`
- Modules: `~/.lucli/modules/`

You normally run `lucli` from your project directory and let it handle the rest.

## Which Java version is required?

LuCLI requires **Java 17+**. Use a recent JDK from your preferred distribution.

## How do I see which Lucee version LuCLI is using?

```bash
lucli --lucee-version
```

## How do I see what LuCLI version I am running?

```bash
lucli --version
```

## How do I uninstall or clean up servers?

You can remove server directories under `~/.lucli/servers/` when they are no longer needed. Make sure they are stopped first via `lucli server stop`.

## How do I report a bug or request a feature?

Use the GitHub issue tracker for the LuCLI repository. Include:

- LuCLI version (`lucli --version`)
- Java version
- Operating system
- Reproduction steps and any relevant logs
