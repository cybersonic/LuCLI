Welcome to the LuCLI docs. This site is organized by **what you want to do**: get started quickly, run CFML from the CLI, manage Lucee servers, and configure projects safely.

Use the sidebar to browse, or start from one of the guided paths below.

## New to LuCLI?

1. **Understand what LuCLI is**  
   Read the high‑level overview:
   - [Introduction](introduction/overview/)

2. **Install LuCLI and run your first server**  
   - [Installation](installation/installation/)
   - [First Run](installation/first-run/)

3. **Learn the basic command shape**  
   - [CLI Basics](cli-basics/cli-basics/)
   - [Help System](cli-basics/help-system/)

## Running CFML from the command line

If you mainly want to run CFML scripts, components, or modules from the CLI:

- [Shortcuts & Direct CFML Execution](cfml-execution/shortcuts-and-direct-execution/)
- [Running Scripts and Components](cfml-execution/running-scripts-and-components/)
- [Interactive Terminal & REPL](cfml-execution/interactive-terminal-and-repl/)
- [CFML Modules](cfml-execution/modules/)

## Managing Lucee servers with `lucee.json`

For project/server configuration and environments:

- [Server Configuration (lucee.json)](server-configuration/lucee-json-basics/)
- [Environment Variables in lucee.json](server-configuration/environment-variables/)
- [Environments and Configuration Overrides](server-configuration/environments-and-overrides/)

- [Configuration Dry‑Run Preview](configuration-preview/dry-run-preview/)

## Security, dependencies, and advanced config

- [Secrets Management](secure-configuration/secrets/)
- [Server Locking](secure-configuration/server-lock/)
- (Overview) Secure configuration page to be added.

Manage libraries and extensions:

- [Dependency Management](dependencies-and-extensions/dependency-management/)
